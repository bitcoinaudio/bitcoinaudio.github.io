# A Blockchain Instrument

We use [jquery](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/) to get blockinfo from [blockcypher](https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/bitcoin/#blockchain-api), then take the Merkle root or Hash of a blockheight, slice it up, and feed it to an instrument using [Tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io/). Please see Blockcypher's [Rate Limits and Tokens](https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/bitcoin/#rate-limits-and-tokens) page.

Bitcoin Carnivorism to the max!
Check [twitter](https://twitter.com/bitcoinaudio?lang=en) for a sample.

The sounds of the blockchain are insteresting to say the least. At most, hypnotic.
